## Step Two: Calculating Time Complexity

Determine the time complexities for each of the following functions. If youâ€™re not sure what these functions do, copy and paste them into the console and experiment with different inputs!

    function logUpTo(n) {
        for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            console.log(i);
        }
    }

Time Complexity: logUpTo(n) is linear O(n), it is not a constant as it will take longer depending on the value of n.
---

    function logAtLeast10(n) {
        for (let i = 1; i <= Math.max(n, 10); i++) {
            console.log(i);
        }
    }

Time Complexity: f(n) is linear O(n) it will print 10 when n is lower than ten but were meassuring for the worst case, being O(n) not O(1).
---

    function logAtMost10(n) {
        for (let i = 1; i <= Math.min(n, 10); i++) {
            console.log(i);
        }
    }

Time Complexity: f(n) is constant O(1) it will never go past 10 iterations

    function onlyElementsAtEvenIndex(array) {
        let newArray = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            if (i % 2 === 0) {
            newArray.push(array[i]);
            }
        }
        return newArray;
    }

Time Complexity: f(n) is linear O(n) , were going through an array and half of the time were executing another command, and updating a value in memory, so it would be something like n/2 .... no? simpified is n as we expand to infinity 
---
    function subtotals(array) {
        let subtotalArray = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            let subtotal = 0;
            for (let j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                subtotal += array[j];
            }
            subtotalArray.push(subtotal);
        }
        return subtotalArray;
    }

Time Complexity: f(n) is quadratic O(n^2) as were lopping throught the array twice, and the second time were pushing the addition of each element before to a value in memory,  
---
    function vowelCount(str) {
        let vowelCount = {};
        const vowels = "aeiouAEIOU";

        for (let char of str) {
            if(vowels.includes(char)) {
                if(char in vowelCount) {
                    vowelCount[char] += 1;
                } else {
                    vowelCount[char] = 1;
                }
            }
        }

    return vowelCount;
    } 

Time Complexity: f(n) is linear O(n) were only looping once through the string and time depends on the length of the string when extended to inifinity..
