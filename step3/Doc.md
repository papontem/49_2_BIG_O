| 1.  | True or false: n^2 + n is O(n^2).                                                                                                                                 | True       |
| 2.  | True or false: n^2 \* n is O(n^3).                                                                                                                                | True       |
| 3.  | True or false: n^2 + n is O(n).                                                                                                                                   | False      |
| 4.  | What’s the time complexity of the .indexOf array method?                                                                                                          | O(n)       |
| 5.  | What’s the time complexity of the .includes array method?                                                                                                         | O(n)       |
| 6.  | What’s the time complexity of the .forEach array method?                                                                                                          | O(n)       |
| 7.  | What’s the time complexity of the .sort array method?     <br> PAM: _O(n!)_ -to- _O(1)_ depends on algorithm sort will be using , sources tell me its typically O(n\*logn) | O(n\*logn) |
| 8.  | What’s the time complexity of the .unshift array method?  <br> PAM: changes index for every element up by one                                                           | O(n)       |
| 9.  | What’s the time complexity of the .push array method?     <br> PAM: nearly instant, constant                                                                                                        | O(1)       |
| 10. | What’s the time complexity of the .splice array method?   <br> PAM: linear to the amount of elements were trying to add to array                                         | O(n)       |
| 11. | What’s the time complexity of the .pop array method?      <br> PAM: nearly isntant, constant                                                                                                        | O(1)       |
| 12. | What’s the time complexity of the Object.keys() function? <br> PAM: linear to the amount of keys that are inside of the object                                         | O(n)       |
