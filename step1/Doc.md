# Big-O Notation Practice

In this exercise, youâ€™ll analyze expressions and code to figure out the time complexity.
Step One: Simplifying Expressions

Simplify the following big O expressions as much as possible:

1. O(n + 10)       
2. O(100 * n)
3. O(25)
4. O(n^2 + n^3)
5. O(n + n + n + n)
6. O(1000 * log(n) + n)
7. O(1000 * n * log(n) + n)
8. O(2^n + n^2)
9. O(5 + 3 + 1)
10. O(n + n^(1/2) + n^2 + n * log(n)^10)

# PAM

going by worst cases portrayed by [this chart](dlzofo8y.jpg)

1. O(n) 
2. O(n)
3. O(1)
4. O(n^3)         worst case is n^3
5. O(n)
6. O(n)           worst case is n
7. O(n * log(n))  worst case is n*log(n)
8. O(2^n)         WORST OF CASES IS 2^n
9. O(1)
10. O(n^2)        WORST OF CASES IS n^2
